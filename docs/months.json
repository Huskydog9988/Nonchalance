Players also notice that the Podcast page password has changed again.\n**CLUES:** If some time passes on the main Spencer page, images and some text appear beneath the find Spencer text. The image is a google street view of a building that says **\"R L Technologies\"**. The text is a series of four instructions - \"8XX-4444\" (with the last four digits crossed out), \"lightworking creating our own realities life\" with a picture of a porpoise crossed out \"#\", \"Rt. on Halleck #\", and \"FTHR-CLMN payment $#\".\n**SOLVING STEPS:** Players follow the trail of the company name in the photo to a google street view of the business, and when the view is rotated a billboard containing a phone number for lawyers comes into view - **\"444-4444\"**. They deduce using the text clue that this gives them the first three digits: 844. For the second part of the clue, googling that text along with \"number meaning\" leads to a blog about angel numbers where the digits 9 (lightworking), 1 (creating our own realities), and 2 (life purpose) are found. For the third clue, the players connect it to the previous surveillance video that was shot on Halleck where two phone numbers can be seen: \"773-3546\" and \"773-3571\". In the Discord, vladdog gives a bone to a player that highlights \"773-3546\" and sends another clue. The players put all that together and come up with the phone number 844-912-3546 to get a hold of **\"Lawyers with Purpose\"**, and they are asked to input a code.

He has trouble talking, and it is always raining. **Kirin** populate the area. He performs some unknown **\"trick\"** and ends up in a much clearer place, and begins speaking normally. He comes to a track where the **ghost train** stops, and tells us the ally he is looking for is not **J or K**, but an **old soul in a new body**. He shifts once again back to the present dimension, and notes that his memories of that place have already begun to fade.
